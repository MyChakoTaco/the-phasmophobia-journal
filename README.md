The Phasmophobia Journal

If you're reading this, I fear it is too late for me, but maybe this guide can save you.

If you're a ghost hunter like me, you'll know that you can determine a ghost based on any three evidence, sometimes even two. I left a very comprehensive guide in hopes that you can figure it out faster than I did.

I pray that I won't be ghosted away like my fellow ghost hunters, but in case I don't make it, I hope this guide serves you well.
